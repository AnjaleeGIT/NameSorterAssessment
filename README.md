# NameSorterAssessment
The program will take a File Path as an argument which contains a list of people and sorts the list of names first by last name, then by any given names the person may have.

The program will check if the list of names has at least 1 given name and up to 3 given names. The list of names is then sorted using the string sort() method and exported 
to the sort-names-list.txt in the working directory and printed on the screen.

Any errors such as invalid names, file not found, no argument provided will throw execeptions and program will exit.
